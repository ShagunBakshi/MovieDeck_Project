# MovieDeck_Project
In this project, I have just used HTML, CSS and JS. 
1. The project shows movie cards and we can sort the movies based on rating and date of release.
2. Also I have there is a favorite tab where we can add and remove our favorite movies.
3. There is a search functionality also which is provided. 
4. The page has a pagination section as well to go to other pages.
